Move `unit_registry` from `src/openscm_units/_unit_registry.py` into `openscm_units/__init__.py`.
This seems to be necessary to make the docs appear correctly without hacks (see [this issue](https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/8547)).
This does not affect users of the public API hence is a trivial change.
