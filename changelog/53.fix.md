Fixed accidental aliasing of "yr" to "a".

We had accidentally assigned "yr" to be an alias for "a".
This meant we had the following behaviour

```python
>>> from openscm_units import unit_registry
>>> val = unit_registry.Quantity(1, "yr")
>>> val
<Quantity(1, 'a')>
```

This PR fixes this so that if you pass in "yr", it stays as yr i.e. you get

```python
>>> from openscm_units import unit_registry
>>> val = unit_registry.Quantity(1, "yr")
>>> val
<Quantity(1, 'yr')>
```
