# Notebooks

Here we provide further documentation related to OpenSCM-Units.
The docs are derived from
[jupyter notebooks](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/start/index.html),
but are saved using [jupytext](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
to keep our repository slim and make it easier to track changes.
